# Housing_Regression
Housing Regression is one of the playgroung level competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).Good place to get your hands dirty and also a great way to learn simple tricks and methods.

This is the competition I to tried out stacking for the first time.
Kaggle has some amazing kernels immensely good at explaining the topics.
