Housing Regression is one of the playgroung level competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).Good place to get your hands dirty and a great way to begin one's  Machine Learning journey.

This is the competition where I first tried out stacking and ensembling .Kaggle has some amazing kernels immensely good at explaining the topics.

Some Kernels which are great to get started with are.
